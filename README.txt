dash notation (192.168.10.1-192.168.10.5) and CIDR notation (192.168.10.1/24). There must not be
a space between the dash and the IP addresses. There also must not be a space between the IP address,
the CIDR number and the slash. There are 2 accepted formats for port ranges: dash notation (1-1000)
and comma delimited notation (21,22,23). There must not be a space between the dashes or commas.
